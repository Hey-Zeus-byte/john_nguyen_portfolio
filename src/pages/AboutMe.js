            <strong>Hello there, I'm John.</strong>
          </span>
          A food lover, blogger, amateur photographer, and designer in San
          Francisco.
          <p>
            The shift in my career happened when I was contacted to redesign a
            menu for a popular brunch restaurant, and saw how visual design can
            solve real-world challenges at scale.
            <p>
              Coming from a background in both supply chain and design, I love
              connecting the dots between user satisfaction, pain points, and
              business goals. In my free time, I enjoy promoting local
              businesses and restaurants through my food blog.
